# TPM vs. Bootkit
Last time [I explained](https://github.com/yo-yo-yo-jbo/bootkit_anatomy/) how Bootkits work.  
This time I want to convince you that all is not lost, and talk about what TPM does to help the situation, including how [Bitlocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/) uses it.

## TPM at a highlevel
The [Trusted Platform Module (TPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) is a dedicated hardware component designed to provide cryptographic functions and platform integrity assurances.  
Integrated into most modern systems, it plays a central role in securing operations such as disk encryption, secure boot, and attestation.  
At its core, the TPM can generate and protect cryptographic keys, securely store secrets, and maintain integrity measurements of the system's boot process using Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  
These capabilities make the TPM a foundational element in modern operating system security features, including BitLocker, which relies on the TPM to protect encryption keys and ensure the system has not been tampered with prior to boot.

### PCRs
One of the most important aspect of the TPM is the concept of `Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).`  
Those are registers that hold the digest of a hash function (e.g. [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) or [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)), thus quite long compared to normal CPU general purpose registers.  
PCRs are addressed by their number, such as `PCR 0`, `PCR1` and so on. Here are common `PCR` numbers and how they're used:

| Number(s) | PCR Purpose                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0         | BIOS/UEFI firmware code                 |
| 1        	| BIOS configuration (setup)              |
| 2	        | Option ROMs (e.g., GPU or NIC firmware) |
| 3	        | MBR or GPT (bootloader components)      |
| 4    	    | Bootloader (e.g., GRUB, Bootmgr)        |
| 5	        | Boot manager configuration              |
| 6	        | OS loader code                          |
| 7	        | Secure Boot policy                      |
| 8â€“15	    | OS-specific drivers and applications    |

Those `PCR` values initially get the value of 0, and then *extended* with TPM functionality - imagine the TPM exposes an API that looks like this:

```
PCRn = TPM_Extend(PCRn, buffer) = hash(PCRn, || hash(buffer))
```

This lets one create a *rolling hash* similar to how blockchain hashes look like. Since hash functions are (supposedly) one-way, supplying even one "wrong" bit to a buffer completely changes the future PCR values.  
The buffers supplied to the `TPM_Extend` function we have just introduced depend on the PCR index. Thus:
- Since `PCR0` contains firmware code rolling hashes, UEFI code is extended there (e.g. `PEI`, `DXE` and so on) as buffers.
- Since `PCR1` contains configuration, we extend hashes of user-defined firmware settings (Secure Boot, boot order, etc).
- Bootloader code is extended into `PCR4`.
- Boot configuration (e.g. GRUB2 commandline or BCD in Windows) are extended into `PCR5`.
- The OS loader code (`winload.efi` for Windows or the Linux kernel for Linux) gets extended into `PCR6`. This might also include drivers loaded at boot time.
- Measurements for Secure Boot (e.g. `KEK`, `DB` and `DBX`) are extneded into `PCR7`.
- Lastly, `PCR8 - PCR15` might be used freely by the OS. On Windows, drivers and boot-time services are extended into those, by the Windows Boot manager.

UEFI uses TCG2 API as such:

```c
EFI_STATUS
HashLogExtendEvent(
  IN EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL*    This,
  IN EFI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS  DataToHash,
  IN UINT64                DataLength,
  IN EFI_TCG2_EVENT*       EfiTcgEvent
);
```

Note the API gets the buffer *as is* (`DataToHash` and `DataLength`) rather than getting a hash - it does the hashing itself.

### Sealing and unsealing
One incredible ability TPM has is the ability to perform *sealing* and *unsealing* of secrets and tie that to PCR values.  
In the following code, we're going to use the [TPM2-tss](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/) APIs, but those are basically wrappers for the "raw" TPM2 interface.  
Here is an example that shows how *sealing* is done:

```c
// Required headers
#include <tss2/tss2_esys.h>
#include <tss2/tss2_mu.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void seal_data(ESYS_CONTEXT *esys_ctx)
{
    TSS2_RC rc;
    ESYS_TR session = ESYS_TR_NONE;
    ESYS_TR primary_handle = ESYS_TR_NONE;
    ESYS_TR sealed_obj_handle = ESYS_TR_NONE;
    TPM2B_PUBLIC *out_public = NULL;
    TPM2B_PRIVATE *out_private = NULL;

    // Start a policy session
    rc = Esys_StartAuthSession(esys_ctx, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, NULL, NULL, TPM2_SE_POLICY, TPM2_ALG_SHA256, TPM2_ALG_SHA256, &session);

    // Build PCR selection (bind to PCR 7)
    TPML_PCR_SELECTION pcr_selection = {
        .count = 1,
        .pcrSelections = {
            {
                .hash = TPM2_ALG_SHA256,
                .sizeofSelect = 3,
                .pcrSelect = {0, 0, 0x80}  // PCR 7
            }
        }
    };

    // Call TPM2_PolicyPCR to bind the session to current PCR[7]
    rc = Esys_PolicyPCR(esys_ctx, session, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, NULL, &pcr_selection);

    // Get the resulting policy digest
    TPM2B_DIGEST *policy_digest = NULL;
    rc = Esys_PolicyGetDigest(esys_ctx, session, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, &policy_digest);

    // Set up object templates
    TPM2B_SENSITIVE_CREATE inSensitive = {
        .size = 0,
        .sensitive = {
            .userAuth = {.size = 0},
            .data = {.size = 6, .buffer = "SECRET"}
        }
    };

    TPM2B_PUBLIC inPublic = {
        .size = 0,
        .publicArea = {
            .type = TPM2_ALG_KEYEDHASH,
            .nameAlg = TPM2_ALG_SHA256,
            .objectAttributes = TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDTPM | TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDPARENT |
                                TPMA_OBJECT_USERWITHAUTH | TPMA_OBJECT_ADMINWITHPOLICY,
            .authPolicy = *policy_digest,
            .parameters.keyedHashDetail = {
                .scheme.scheme = TPM2_ALG_NULL,
            },
            .unique.keyedHash.size = 0,
        }
    };

    // Create primary key under the owner hierarchy
    rc = Esys_CreatePrimary(esys_ctx, ESYS_TR_RH_OWNER, ESYS_TR_PASSWORD, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        ESYS_TR_NONE, &inSensitive, &inPublic, NULL, NULL, &primary_handle,
        NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    // Create the sealed object under the primary key
    rc = Esys_Create(esys_ctx, primary_handle, ESYS_TR_PASSWORD, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        &inSensitive, &inPublic, NULL, NULL, &out_private, &out_public, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    // Done with session
    Esys_FlushContext(esys_ctx, session);
}
```

Let's follow the concepts of this code:
1. We call `Esys_StartAuthSession` to create a session.
2. We define a `TPML_PCR_SELECTION` structure that defines the `PCR` values we are interested of binding the sealing with. In our case we chose `PCR7`, which corresponds to the value `0x80` (it's a bitmask). Of course, we could bind it to multiple `PCR` values.
3. We call `Esys_PolicyPCR` to declare that data structure (the `PCR` selection) and bind that to the session we created.
4. We generate a structure of type `TPM2B_SENSITIVE_CREATE` which will contain the secret buffer in it (the buffer we are going to seal).
5. We create a *primary key* with `Esys_CreatePrimary` for the particular secret. There is a hierarchy associated with public keys but we won't do a deep dive here.
6. We create a sealed object under that primary key using `Esys_Create`.

To unseal, we do the following:

```c
void unseal_data(ESYS_CONTEXT *esys_ctx, ESYS_TR parent_handle,
                 TPM2B_PRIVATE *in_private, TPM2B_PUBLIC *in_public) {
    TSS2_RC rc;
    ESYS_TR session = ESYS_TR_NONE;
    ESYS_TR sealed_handle = ESYS_TR_NONE;

    // Load the object under the primary key
    rc = Esys_Load(esys_ctx, parent_handle, ESYS_TR_PASSWORD, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        in_private, in_public, &sealed_handle);

    // Start a policy session
    rc = Esys_StartAuthSession(esys_ctx, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        ESYS_TR_NONE, NULL, NULL,
        TPM2_SE_POLICY, TPM2_ALG_SHA256, TPM2_ALG_SHA256, &session);

    // Re-bind to PCR 7 (must match the PCR state at sealing time)
    TPML_PCR_SELECTION pcr_selection = {
        .count = 1,
        .pcrSelections = {
            {
                .hash = TPM2_ALG_SHA256,
                .sizeofSelect = 3,
                .pcrSelect = {0, 0, 0x80}
            }
        }
    };

    rc = Esys_PolicyPCR(esys_ctx, session, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        NULL, &pcr_selection);

    // Now unseal the data
    TPM2B_SENSITIVE_DATA *out_data = NULL;
    rc = Esys_Unseal(esys_ctx, sealed_handle, session, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, &out_data);

    if (rc == TSS2_RC_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Unsealed data: %.*s\n", out_data->size, out_data->buffer);
    } else {
        printf("Unseal failed: 0x%x\n", rc);
    }

    // Cleanup
    Esys_FlushContext(esys_ctx, session);
    Esys_FlushContext(esys_ctx, sealed_handle);
}
```

1. Note we've done similar first steps - we have created a session, defined a PCR selection structure and perform a binding using `Esys_PolicyPCR`.
2. Now we call `Esys_Unseal` to unseal the data. The most important thing is this - *unsealing fails if the PCR selection and the values themselves mismatch*.

That is a very powerful thing - this means unsealing data now is tightly bound to the boot order, configuration, and generally - buffers controlled by the firmware.  
We'll see how Bitlocker uses that!

### Bitlocker and sealing
[Bitlocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/) uses something called `VEK`, which stands for `Volume Encryption Key`.  
It is a symmetric [AES key](https://github.com/yo-yo-yo-jbo/crypto_terminology/) used by BitLocker to actually encrypt and decrypt sectors on the disk.  
Each BitLocker-encrypted volume has its own `VEK` and it's different on every machine. The magic? It's *sealed* in the TPM!  
In practice, Bitlocker uses `PCR0`, `PCR2`, `PCR4`, `PCR7` and `PCR11` for PCR-context sealing.

## Why does my Bootkit fail?
My own Bootkit relied on vulnerabilities in `GRUB2`, which means that on Windows, my strategy would be a bit convoluted:
1. Replace the Windows bootloader with a Shim that calls `GRUB2`. Note that due to Secure Boot this is a necessary step since I cannot run arbitrary code yet.
2. Exploit one of the vulnerabilities I discovered. Successful exploitation lets me run arbitrary code at this point.
3. Perform the steps I mentioned in my [previous blogpost](https://github.com/yo-yo-yo-jbo/bootkit_anatomy/), starting with patching the UEFI services.
4. Pass control to the Windows loader.

Well, because I replaced the bootloader, the value of `PCR4` is completely ruined, which means Bitlocker won't be able to unseal its `VEK`!  
At this point, Bitlocker actually doesn't give up but asks for a special key from the user's IT department. While that's a fascinating subject, we won't be discussing that in this blogpost.  
The conclusion is that my Bootkit does *not* beat Bitlocker, which is a good thing for end-user privacy!  
At this point, you might have some ideas on how to bypass those restrictions. Here are some common ones and why they do not work:

### Attempt 1: replaying the PCR values
One idea you might have is straight-forward - we might have intimate knowledge about the boot process and the buffers extneded in each `PCR` value, so, we could perform the same calculation and get to the "desired" PCR values!  
While that approah makes a lot of sense, it doesn't work because there are no known ways of resetting the `PCR` values back to zero without power-cycling the TPM, which in principle cannot be done without a CPU reboot.  
There are some interesting nuances about Windows hibernation and S3 sleep mode: when coming back from hibernation, there is a way to set the `PCR` values to a specific values, but it can only be done *once* - TPM will block further attempts to do so until the next time it power-cycles or goes to sleep mode.

### Attempt 2: vTPM
One other idea would be fooling Windows enough and implement a TPM in software. That works in a sense that you can set arbitrary `PCR` values, but since your software TPM doesn't have the `VEK` or any secret, this fails.  
That approach *does* work, however, if you already implemented your vTPM when installing Bitlocker itself, which is a huge assumption (and an overkill anyway - there are easier ways to achieve the same effect, e.g. just saving the plaintext `VEK` somewhere).

### Attempt 3: VEK extraction
The values on the TPM are encrypted with a key fused to the TPM chip and unique, so you cannot extract the `VEK` from the TPM.  
I do want to emphasize the `VEK` is used bit Bitlocker, and therefore resides in RAM (after unsealing). Therefore, things like [DMA attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack) on Bitlocker do work (under some circumstances), but using DMA attacks commonly requires physical access to a device so I will consider it out-of-scope for this blogpost.

### When bootkits do work?
Bootkits might work if running them does not change the `PCR` values. For example, if you found a vulnerability in the Windows bootloader itself that allows you to run arbitrary code due to a memory corruption, then your Bootkit might also bypass Bitlocker.

## Summary
I hope I was able to explain in this blogpost why even a Bookit is not the end of all things (it is still severe though!).  
By a clever use of basic cryptogaphic principles (symmetric encryption and hash functions) modern systems get secure even in the face of Bootkits.

Stay tuned!
